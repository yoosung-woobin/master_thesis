The dataset used in this paper is from *Welch and Goyal (2008)* which are macroeconomic variables with S&P500 index.
They are accessible through Prof. Goyal's personal website. <http://www.hec.unil.ch/agoyal/docs/PredictorData2017.xlsx>

There are three Jupyter Notebook files uploaded regarding the thesis.

1. <> is for deriving the test-bed results of GLM with penalization and PLS which are directly inspired by 
*Feng, He, and Polson (2018)*.

2. <MasterThesis_NN_ver17(PC).ipynb> provides steps for producing MLP result, as well as LSTM prediction result. MLP combined with models from 1 
serves as test bed against LSTM to explore the possibility of applying LSTM to asset return prediction in macroeconomic level

3. <> provides codes for producing summary tables and figures used in the thesis.
